        There are many ways to gain critical thinking skills: reading a textbook, attending a <br />
        lecture, or learning from past experience. In this E-book, you will have an opportunity <br />
        to learn how to apply critical thinking skills to business issues through the eyes of <br />
        an individual facing many of the same issues as your customers, Dr. George <br />
        Osborne.
    </p>
    <p> Through a series of interactive <br />
        exercises, you will help  <br />
        Dr. Osborne analyze his daily <br />
        challenges, weigh his options, <br />
        and select and implement a <br />
        course of action to address <br />
        his challenges. Your objective <br />
        in working with this E-book <br />
        is to develop a personal <br />
        approach to applying <br />
        critical thinking in your <br />
        daily life.</p>

                <p>The next afternoon was full of patients with a new strain of ﬂu. <br />
                   George spent his time going from one exam room to the next, <br />
                   talking to his patients, and remembering why he loved being a <br />
                   doctor. <br />
                   <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:10pt;"></span>
                   When he ﬁnally had a break in his appointments, George decided <br />
                   to take a walk to clear his head and think a little more about <br />
                   the medical center and the fate of his practice. As he walked, <br />
                   his mind wandered. “What if one of my patients can’t get in for <br />
                   an appointment with me and switches to a new doctor at the <br />
                   medical center?” he thought. “What if the center’s slick equipment <br />
                   is a draw? And they probably accept all kinds of insurance.”<br />
                   <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:10pt;"></span>
                   George felt light-headed and stumbled to a bench. “I’ve got to <br />
                   pull myself together,” he chided himself. “I hate this business <br />
                   stuff, but I have to do it. No way am I going to let this medical <br />
                   center scuttle my life’s work.” George Osborne would not give up <br />
                   without a ﬁght.

                <p>While waiting for Wendy to arrive for their strategy session,  <br />
                   George studied the sticky notes from the brainstorming session  <br />
                   and wondered how they translate into a plan to save his business.  <br />
                   His staff had generated some great ideas. George was glad to  <br />
                   have some options now.  <br />
                   <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:10pt;"></span>
                   “Of course, I can get new furniture and hire an IT guy. But what

                    about opening a home health service? Wendy’s right. If I want <br />
                    to be competitive, I need to focus on long-term projects ﬁrst. <br />
                    But, which one?” George suddenly felt overwhelmed. He needed <br />
                    Wendy’s advice.<br />
                    <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:10pt;"></span>
                    When they met the next day, Wendy asked George, “Now that you <br />
                    have a list of opportunities, any thoughts on where to start?”

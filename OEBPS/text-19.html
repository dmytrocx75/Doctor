        <p>“George, give me a minute to explain. Go/No Go is ﬁne when you <br />
           have only a few options and the answer is pretty straightforward. The<br />
           problem is when you have many factors to consider and they all seem <br />
           important. Weighting each factor gives you a way to formalize your <br />
           <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:-1pt;"></span>
           thought process and diﬀerentiate between choices when the answer <br />
           is not clear. Another advantage to weighting is that it helps you avoid <br />
           making a decision based on your biases.”<br />
           <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:10pt;"></span>
           Wendy continued, “So, George, what are the success factors that you <br />
           <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:-1pt;"></span>
           feel are most critical in your solution?” <br />
           <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:10pt;"></span>
           George thought for a minute and oﬀered, “Certainly, cost-effectiveness <br />
           is important. And the amount of time it will take to implement. First and <br />
           foremost, the solution must not disturb my work with patients. Also, if I <br />
           <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:-1pt;"></span>
           invest in something, I want it to beneﬁt as many patients as possible.”<br />
           <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:10pt;"></span>
           “Great! Let’s list them and assign the weights from 1 to 10, with 10 <br />
           being the highest.”<br />
           <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:9pt;"></span>
           George plopped down at his desk. “Okay, Wendy, now what?” <br />
           <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:10pt;"></span>
            “The only thing left is to multiply the weights by the ratings for each <br />
           success factor, and add up your results for each option. Once you have 
           <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:2pt;"></span>
           the ﬁnal scores, you’ll know which option is the winner we can run with.”
           <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:11pt;"></span>
           “Great job, George! &nbsp;Look at the numbers. We’ve got a clear winner. 
           <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:2pt;"></span>
            Now let’s get started on our implementation plan. I’d like you to get
            </p>
            <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:-7pt;"></span>
            together with your staff this week and discuss what &nbsp;&nbsp;‘advertising in
            <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:2pt;"></span>
            different ways’ means to all of you. I’ll come back next week and we can
            <span style="display:block; margin-bottom:1pt;"></span>
            debrief and start putting a plan together.”
